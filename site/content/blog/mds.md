A year ago, I was very unsure about my future and what it entailed and now, I have officially completed my Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia. Well... I'm still very unsure about my future especially with the current state of the world and COVID-19, however I am confident that this program has set a solid foundation for the start of my data science career. Rather than talking about all the skills and tools that I learned over the past 10 months (because you can learn about the program [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/)), I want this post to focus more on what I learned about myself and how MDS has shaped my data science journey. 

#### What I learned

- Before the program, I struggled to figure out what aspect of data science I enjoy the most. I'm aware that the field of data science is becoming more and more specialized, however I see myself as a generalist. I enjoy the whole process of a data science project and trying to solve the big picture problems. I think it's crucial to always keep the main objectives in mind because I found that my classmates and myself sometimes got too carried away with the nitty-gritty details. I hope to take more of a general data scientist, consulting, or product management related role in the future. 

- MDS was full of elaborate full stack team projects that required many moving parts. With so much talent and different strengths across team members, trying to figure out how to best tackle each project was a challenge. We had to strike a balance between leveraging our strengths and learning every aspect of each project. I found that having well defined roles and responsibilities ensured we kept each other accountable and that we were all doing tasks that we could best excel at.

- Without proper communication, data science is just a bunch of numbers and graphs. Being able to communicate results well is just as important as the work that goes into producing the results. If those results can't be translated well to your managers or stakeholders, then those results are practically useless. I had many opportunities to practice communicating to both technical and non-technical audiences through my class projects and capstone project. What I found really useful was to use a bottom-up approach in which you utilize a lot of examples and put emphasis on practicality. 

- MDS was no doubt an intense program. All throughout the program, we had 4 labs every week and quizzes almost every other week. I've learned that perfection is not necessary and often in industry it's more important to produce a minimal viable product quickly rather than spending too much time on the details, especially when there's a time constraint. I still consider myself detail-oriented, however I prioritize completing my work first and then later going back to make further improvements.

- MDS was an extremely diverse program in terms of age, culture, and educational background. Joining the program right after my undergrad, this was my real first taste at being in a very diverse working environment. At the beginning of the program, I felt a lot of stress and pressure as I was constantly comparing myself to many of my classmates. I quickly learned to acknowledge that everyone is at different stages in their life and careers. I'm just starting off my career so it's unreasonable to compare myself to those who have years of work experience. Out in the real world, there's always going to be people who are better than me in some way, shape or form, but I'm constantly reminding myself that the only person I should compare myself to is yesterday's version of myself.
